# Upgrade

# Command line

You can also use the `rancherd upgrade` command on a `server` node to automatically 
upgrade RancherOS, Rancher, and/or Kubernetes.

# Kubernetes API

All components in RancherOS are managed using Kubernetes. Below is how
to use Kubernetes approaches to upgrade the components.

## RancherOS

RancherOS is upgraded with the RancherOS operator. Refer to the
[RancherOS Operator](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancheros-operator/blob/main/README.md) documentation for complete information, but the
TL;DR is

```bash
kubectl edit -n fleet-local default-os-image
```
```yaml
apiVersion: rancheros.cattle.io/v1
kind: ManagedOSImage
metadata:
  name: default-os-image
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  # Set to the new RancherOS version you would like to upgrade to
  osImage: quay.io/costoolkit/os2:v0.0.0
```

## rancherd

Rancherd itself doesn't need to be upgraded. It is only ran once per node
to bootstrap the system and then after that provides no value. Rancherd is
packaged in the OS image so newer versions of Rancherd will come with newer
versions of RancherOS.

## Rancher
Rancher is installed as a helm chart following the standard procedure. You can upgrade
Rancher with the [standard procedure documented](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/upgrades/).

## Kubernetes
To upgrade Kubernetes you will use Rancher to orchestrate the upgrade. This is a matter of changing
the Kubernetes version on the `fleet-local/local` `Cluster` in the `provisioning.cattle.io/v1`
apiVersion.  For example

```shell
kubectl edit clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n fleet-local local
```
```yaml
apiVersion: provisioning.cattle.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: local
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  # Change to new valid k8s version, >= 1.21
  # Valid versions are
  # k3s: curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/kontainer-driver-metadata/release-v2.6/data/data.json | jq -r '.k3s.releases[].version'
  # RKE2: curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/kontainer-driver-metadata/release-v2.6/data/data.json | jq -r '.rke2.releases[].version'
  kubernetesVersion: v1.21.4+k3s1
```
