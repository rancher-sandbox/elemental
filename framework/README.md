The framework folder contains the files which are pertinent to the cOS framework.

Note, the `cos` folder is automatically generated by running `make update-cos-framework` from the git root directory, this mechanism is in place until the [upstream](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cOS-toolkit/issues/1305) airgap install feature is implemented.

Don't do any direct change to the `cos` folder. It will be automatically updated by our automation bot. Instead, if you do need to apply any framework change, use the `file` folder.

The `files` folder contains os2-specific framework configuration files which alters the default behavior and apply custom configuration according to the cOS documentation. This is the main entrypoint to do changes of os2 in regard to the cOS featureset. If you do need to do any change to customize os2 settings, it belongs here.
